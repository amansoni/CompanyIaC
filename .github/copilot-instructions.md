# Project general coding guidelines

## Code Style
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, section, article, etc.) and ensure it's accessible
- Prefer modern JavaScript (ES6+) features like const/let, arrow functions, and template literals
- Separate markup, styles, and scripts into their own files
- Include modern CSS styling and make it responsive
-

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Code Quality
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose
- Include helpful comments for complex logic
- Add error handling for user inputs and API calls
