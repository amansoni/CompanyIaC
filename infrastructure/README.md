# Infrastructure

The foundation of Traefik, Keycloak, and Docker Compose is excellent for provisioning a secure environment. However, for a robust, production-ready, and maintainable company infrastructure, you need to add services focused on **Observability, Security, and Operations.**

Here are the essential tools and services to integrate:

---

## 1. Observability (Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing)

Knowing the health and performance of your services is critical.

| Tool/Service | Purpose in this IaC |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prometheus** | **Metrics Collection:** Scrapes metrics from Traefik (for traffic/latency), Keycloak (if enabled), and your application containers. Essential for tracking system health over time. |
| **Grafana** | **Visualization & Alerting:** Connects to Prometheus to create dashboards for visual monitoring. You can build dashboards to track key metrics like: *Traefik request rate*, *Keycloak login success rate*, and *container CPU/Memory usage*. |
| **Loki** | **Log Aggregation:** An alternative or complement to Prometheus, designed to aggregate and index logs from all your containers. This allows you to search and analyze logs from a central location, crucial for troubleshooting. |
| **cAdvisor / Node Exporter** | **Host & Container Metrics:** Containers to collect resource usage, performance metrics, and general health data from the Docker host (Node Exporter) and running containers (cAdvisor). |

### Implementation Note:
This is often referred to as the **"TICK"** or **"Prometheus/Grafana Stack"** and would be a dedicated section in your `docker-compose.yml`.

## 2. Advanced Security & DDoS Protection

While Keycloak handles authentication, you should add a layer of perimeter security.

| Tool/Service | Purpose in this IaC |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CrowdSec** | **Intrusion Prevention/WAF:** A collaborative security engine that reads logs (from Traefik and others) to detect and block malicious IPs (e.g., brute-force login attempts, port scanning). You can configure it to feed its blocklist directly to a Traefik middleware. |
| **Fail2ban (or similar service on host)**| **Brute-Force Prevention:** While CrowdSec is modern, a traditional or containerized tool to monitor Traefik/SSH logs and automatically update firewall rules is a classic layer of defense. |
| **A Forward Auth Middleware (e.g., `oauth2-proxy`)** | **Security Helper:** While Keycloak is in the stack, an additional proxy container like `oauth2-proxy` can be used as a Traefik middleware to handle the complexity of the OIDC/OAuth2 flow, then forward a clean JWT token to the upstream application. This is a common pattern to keep application logic simple. |

## 3. Operational Tools

Tools that simplify administration, secrets management, and maintenance.

| Tool/Service | Purpose in this IaC |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Watchtower** | **Automated Updates:** Monitors running containers (Traefik, Keycloak, etc.) and checks Docker Hub (or your private registry) for new image versions. It then automatically stops the old container, pulls the new image, and restarts the container. |
| **Vault (or Consul KV)** | **Secrets Management:** For production, environment variables like database passwords (`DB_PASSWORD` for Keycloak's database) should not be stored in plain text in the `docker-compose.yml` or an `.env` file. HashiCorp **Vault** can be added to securely store, access, and rotate these secrets. |
| **Database Backup Container** | **Data Integrity:** A dedicated container (often using a tool like `pg_dump` for a PostgreSQL Keycloak database) that runs on a schedule to take backups of the persistent data volume and store them in an external volume or cloud storage. |
| **Portainer (Optional)** | **Web UI Management:** A lightweight management UI for your Docker environment. It provides a simple web interface to view the status of your containers, logs, volumes, and networks, which is useful for non-CLI users. |
